## Gentrification of King County: 2009 & 2017

Our final project for this course focuses on visualizing gentrification among King County census tracts, and how this phenomenon compares between the years 2009 and 2017. Included is an R Markdown HTML Document that gives context on the issue of gentrification, displays interactive maps, and summarizes our findings.
